### Godrop
Discover peers in the local network and share files with them.
Godrop utilizes MDNS to discover the local address of potential peers. 

On one machine run `godrop < cat.jpg` and on another one run `godrop > theCatImageFromThePeer.jpg` . 
You really aren't restricted to what you share. Godrop reads from stdin and writes to stdout on the peers side.
